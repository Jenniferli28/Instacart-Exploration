I first tried opening the data set using this string of code to see how the data will come out. 

SELECT * 
FROM ic_order_products_curr AS curr
FULL JOIN ic_order_products_prior AS prior
ON curr.order_id = prior.order_id
FULL JOIN ic_products AS prod
ON prior.product_id = prod.product_id
FULL JOIN ic_departments AS dep
ON prod.department_id = dep.department_id
FULL JOIN ic_aisles AS ais
ON prod.aisle_id = ais.aisle_id

Before I continue, I want to preface that I was using a Lenovo Slim 7 Carbon laptop. By not selecting specific things that I wanted to see, my laptop ended up becoming extremely slow trying while trying to run this string of code (which is wrong to begin with).

The output returned a lot of null cells and I was unable to see the entire output due to the limitations of my laptop.
