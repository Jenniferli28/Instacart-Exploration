First notable change that I did was switching the tables in the FROM so that I can properly JOIN all the tables without returning and NULL values.

SELECT *
FROM ic_products AS prod
JOIN ic_order_products_prior AS prio
ON prod.product_id = prio.product_id
JOIN ic_order_products_curr AS curr
ON prod.product_id = curr.product_id
JOIN ic_departments AS dep
ON prod.department_id = dep.department_id
JOIN ic_aisles AS ais
ON prod.aisle_id = ais.aisle_id
ORDER BY product_name, department

The table that ended up showing was significantly better, and I even added in an ORDER BY for an even cleaner output. Although it resulted in a cleaner output, it ended up showing every individual item and product.
