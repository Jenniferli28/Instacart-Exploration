# Instacart-Exploration
This repository is for practicing my data analytical skills. I am using the data source from DataLemur (https://datalemur.com/questions/instacart-exploration), which uses a data source from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data


Following DataLemur, it gives the schemas for 5 tables in the Instacart market data. 
- ic_order_products_curr
- ic_order_products_prior
- ic_products
- ic_departments
- ic_aisles

Using these tables given, I am tasked with answering questions such as "how many items are there?" and "How many different products are in the dataset?"
